# Work Day Planner

## Description

A work day planner made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript along with elements from Bootstrap and JQuery.  The planner is set for a 'typical' work day and allows you to type within the boxes whatever you need to plan for.  It also is color coded to display whether the current hour has passed, is on the current hour, or if the hour is set in the future.  The top area also will update the current date along with the day of (ex. Saturday, Sunday, etc.).  

* Gray background = past hour
* Red background = present hour
* Green background = future hour
